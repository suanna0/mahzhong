            Computer Science has been sterilized in the public imagination, largely shaped by the legacy of Apple’s iOS 7 release in 2013. Apple’s sleek, minimalist aesthetic, which other large corporations have followed, has gentrified tech’s visual culture. We want to push back by embracing a language that is familiar to us–academic computer diagrams, maximalist graphic design, and nostalgic iconography of the Asian Diasporic experience.

            Our work draws from a distinctly Chinese mode of communication—found in the layered, bustling streets of cities. At the same time, we’re frustrated by how Asia is flattened in sci-fi media, often reduced to a cold, dystopian aesthetic. By merging these two perspectives, we reclaim and humanize them. While the western canon has contaminated tech, we still hope to spark new conversation through sharing our unique upbringing.
